# CS390 Web Application Programming üöÄ

**Welcome to your journey into full-stack web development!** 

This 12-week course is designed to help you grow as a developer while encouraging creativity, curiosity, and collaboration. We'll guide you through building a complete full-stack website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and by the end, you'll have the skills and confidence to build real-world web applications.

The curriculum progresses thoughtfully from refreshing the basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to advanced front-end and back-end topics, culminating in a hands-on capstone project you'll be proud to show off. Each week introduces new tools and concepts through practical coding exercises, because we believe in **learning by doing**.

Everything here is structured to support your success, and I want you to feel confident and excited about what you're building! üéØ
