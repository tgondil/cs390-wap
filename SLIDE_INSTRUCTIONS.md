### 1. One Slide per Screen
- Each slide must occupy **exactly one screen height**.
- Ensure that all content fits within the viewport without scrolling.

### 2. Slide Counter
- Every time a new slide is created, **increment the slide counter**.
- Append the slide number to the slide visually or programmatically to keep track.

### 3. Folder Structure
- Each class should have its own folder under the `components/` directory.
- Example structure:
components/
└── Class1/
├── Slide1.jsx
├── Slide2.jsx
└── ...

### 4. Interactivity
- **All slides must be interactive**.
- Use UI elements like:
- Buttons
- Inputs
- Hover effects
- Draggable/resizable items
- Any other engaging UI patterns
- Avoid purely static content unless part of an interactive flow.

### 5. Reference File
- Use `class1slides.js` as the baseline reference for structure, layout, and logic.
