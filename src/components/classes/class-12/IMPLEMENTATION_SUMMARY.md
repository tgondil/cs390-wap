## Key Learning Objectives

Students will learn to:

1. ✅ **Set up Mongoose schemas** with proper validation and defaults
2. ✅ **Implement relationships** using embedding and referencing patterns
3. ✅ **Use .populate()** to join data across collections
4. ✅ **Build REST APIs** with three complete endpoints
5. ✅ **Apply best practices** for production-ready code

---

## Mini Lab: User → Posts API

Students will build a complete REST API with three endpoints:

### Endpoints:
1. **GET /api/posts** 
   - Return all posts with author populated
   - Select only username and email

2. **POST /api/posts**
   - Create new post with validation
   - Title and content required
   - Populate author in response

3. **GET /api/users/:id**
   - Return user details
   - Include summary of 5 most recent posts
   - Include total post count

### Technologies Used:
- Express.js
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- Environment variables (dotenv)

---

## Code Examples Provided

### Complete Working Examples:
- ✅ User model with validation
- ✅ Post model with reference to User
- ✅ Embedding pattern (user with addresses)
- ✅ Referencing pattern (posts with author)
- ✅ Population (basic and selective)
- ✅ Subdocument manipulation
- ✅ REST API routes with error handling
- ✅ Validation error handling
- ✅ Database connection setup

---

## Real-World Patterns

### Schema Design Patterns Covered:
1. **User → Posts** (one-to-many with references)
2. **User → Addresses** (one-to-few with embedding)
3. **Post → Comments** (volume-dependent)
4. **Students ↔ Courses** (many-to-many)
5. **Blog Platform** (complete example)

---

## Best Practices Taught

1. ✅ Always validate at schema level
2. ✅ Use timestamps for automatic tracking
3. ✅ Selective population to optimize performance
4. ✅ Index frequently queried fields
5. ✅ Handle errors with appropriate status codes
6. ✅ Use virtuals for computed properties
7. ✅ Choose embedding vs referencing based on data size

---

## Common Pitfalls Addressed

1. ❌ Forgetting to populate references
2. ❌ Not handling validation errors
3. ❌ Over-populating (fetching unnecessary data)
4. ❌ Using Mixed type (loses validation)
5. ❌ Not considering array size limits

---

## Testing & Validation

### Build Status:
✅ **Compiled successfully** (no errors)
✅ **No linting errors**
✅ **All imports resolved**
✅ **Slides render correctly**

### Quality Checks:
- ✅ Comprehensive content (30 slides)
- ✅ Code examples tested
- ✅ Consistent styling and formatting
- ✅ Keyboard navigation working
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Animation effects smooth
