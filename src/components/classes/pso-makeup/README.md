## Message from Tanay

I've been working through grades and I noticed most of you missed a few PSOs. This opportunity is your **last chance** to work on the PSOs before we transition to the final project. 

I really want all of you to learn as much as possible during this class, and not having done everything as I've planned is not doing that.

### The Opportunity

- **If you're under the number of drops:** This will be **extra credit**
- **If you've dropped more than you should have:** You can **make up one of those drops**
